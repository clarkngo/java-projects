# Java Projects

Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))

### JRE vs JDK
JDK is for development purpose whereas JRE is for running the java programs. JDK and JRE both contains JVM so that we can run our java program. JVM is the heart of java programming language and provides platform independence.

You need JDK to develop Java Apps. If you only need to run Java Apps, JRE is enough.
